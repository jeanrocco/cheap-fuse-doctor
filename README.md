  Just some pretty printings, to help my failing memory, to an excellent instructable: <a href="https://www.instructables.com/id/Simple-and-cheap-Fuse-Doctor-for-Attiny/">Attiny fuse doctor</a>  
  
  Thank's !

  Just in case this stuff disapears from instructables, I just added some pictures and fritzing breadboard and schematic views.
    
  New Stuff: from https://www.hackster.io/sbinder/attiny85-powered-high-voltage-avr-programmer-3324e1
  
  This is the simplest fuse programmer so far, and it works fine after I added 10 uF and a 0.1 uF between +5 and ground.
  I also added a 1K resistor on the base of the transistor. You can see my version at: https://github.com/jeanrocco/cheap-fuse-doctor/blob/master/FuseDoctor_Master_Attiny85.fzz , with a copy of the .ino code included.
  
  enjoy !
